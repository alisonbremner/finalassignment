            <p class="first">It is made from a blend of cotton and elastane.</p><br>

      <p>Due to unrealistic demands, as a result of fast fashion and overconsumption, cotton farming has become an industry that places a great amount of economic and environmental strain on developing nations.</p><br>
      <p>Once the fourth largest lake in the world, the Aral Sea has been drained for the irrigation of cotton crops. This is just one of the many downsides of conventional cotton farming.</p><br>
      <p>We haven't even mentioned the harmful pecticides, injuries and farmer suicides that also come with farming this crop.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the damage is enhanced as the fabrics are produced in countries which don’t have the correct infrastructure to dispose of chemical waste correctly.</p><br>
      <p>Bleaches, dyes, acids, and other hazardous chemicals run from factories directly to bodies of water, which sometimes can be a village’s main source of water. </p><br>
      <p>Overcrowded, unsafe and unjust, offshore factories are exploiting and risking the lives thousands of people everyday. And that's exactly where our t-shirt is headed now.</p>

      <p> In 2013, over 1,100 people were killed in a garment factory in Bangladesh that collapsed - even though supervisors and management were made aware of the building’s structural faults the previous day.</p><br>
      <p> Whilst manufacturing can be seen as a vital step towards economic development for developing nations, increased pressure placed on factories to lower prices from the western world has meant we’ve cut costs by lowering the value of the lives of others.</p><br>
      <p>We should know better.</p>

      <p>Now our t-shirt is packed and headed to the store to be purchased by customers. It’s been reported that on average, a piece of clothing is only worn seven times, because making sure you aren’t pictured in the same outfit more than once is much more important than the wellbeing of the environment and the lives of others. </p><br>
      <p>Due to the synthetic fibres that have been mixed with the cotton to make this t-shirt, it’s no longer readily biodegradable and can take up to 200 years to start breaking down.</p>
